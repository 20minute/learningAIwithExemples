We have finished question 1 - 5

When you launch the game, the 2 leaders are wandering, but you can control one of them (the green one) by clicking "Manually control on/off" in the "Control" section.
You can control it with the WASD keys.

To show different roles, you need to click "Show color" in the "Info" section.

To make the chaser follow their respective leader, you have to activate "Weighted Sum" in the "Calculate Method" section.
As you can see the red leader has the chasers following it in line and the green leader has its chasers forming a round around it.
